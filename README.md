# Diabetes-Analysis

## Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to identify key factors contributing to diabetes (Outcome) using univariate and multivariate analyses. 
The dataset comprises several features, including Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, and Outcome. 
By understanding the relationships between these features and diabetes, we aim to provide actionable insights for better diagnosis, prevention, and management.

## Overview of the Dataset

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following features:
Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, and Outcome.

- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancy
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
- Bloodprssure: Diastolic bloodpressure
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin
-  BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/ height in meter square)
-  DiabetesPedigreeFunction: This indicates the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
-  age:age(in years)
- Outcome: The target variable, whether a patient is diagnose with diabetes or not(0 for No, 1 for yes)
